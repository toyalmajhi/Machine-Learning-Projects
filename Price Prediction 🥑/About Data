# 🥑 Predicting the Prices of Avocados

This project focuses on predicting the average price of avocados using historical retail data from 2018. The dataset includes weekly sales records, pricing, and regional information, offering a solid foundation for building regression models and exploring time series trends.

### 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset represents **weekly 2018 retail scan data** for national avocado sales. Retail scan data is gathered directly from retailers’ cash registers and reflects actual retail sales of **Hass avocados**.

> 💡 Starting in 2013, the data was expanded to cover multiple retail outlets including grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military channels.

📦 **Key Features in the Dataset**:
- `Date`: Date of the observation.
- `AveragePrice`: The average price of a single avocado.
- `type`: Type of avocado — *conventional* or *organic*.
- `year`: Year of the observation.
- `Region`: City or region of sale.
- `Total Volume`: Total number of avocados sold.
- `4046`, `4225`, `4770`: Volume sold by PLU codes (representing different avocado sizes).
